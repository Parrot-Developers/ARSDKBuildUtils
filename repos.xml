   SDK3 Repo declaration :

   </webfile>
   
   In any type, postDownloadAction is optionnal

   If the branch/tag/commit/DEV part is not provided, master will be used

   If a branch is provided, the build script will ensure that the local repo
   is on a local branch, tracking the "remote/origin/branch" branch. It will
   also try to update the branch to the latest revision

   If a tag or a commit sha1 is provided, the build script will ensure that
   the local repo is correctly on this tag/commit

   If DEV is provided, the script won't touch the repository status (it will
   still clone it into master if non-existant). This options should only be
   use by the SDK developers

   In all cases, no checkout/pull actions will be taken if the repository
   contains local commits, uncommited changes, or anything that might need
   a merge or a rebase. In this case, the script will fail with an error
   message

  <!--
     The ARBuildUtils repo (this one, here) is not included
     because of different issues with a self-update:
     - Some scripts are already opened when the update is done
     and won't change in the python/bash engines
     - Any local changes (including to this file to select others revisions)
     will break the build, as the current repo would have changed files
